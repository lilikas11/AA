hippopotamus remembered small soon made mouse slipped like “would use now” thought alice “to speak mouse everything outoftheway think likely talk rate there’s harm trying” began “o mouse know way pool tired swimming mouse” alice thought must right way speaking mouse never done thing remembered seen brother’s latin grammar “a mouse—of mouse—to mouse—a mouse—o mouse” mouse looked rather inquisitively seemed wink one little eyes said nothing “perhaps doesn’t understand english” thought alice “i daresay it’s french mouse come william conqueror” knowledge history alice clear notion long ago anything happened began “où est chatte” first sentence french lessonbook mouse gave sudden leap water seemed quiver fright “oh beg pardon” cried alice hastily afraid hurt poor animal’s feelings “i quite forgot didn’t like cats” “not like cats” cried mouse shrill passionate voice “would like cats me” “well perhaps not” said alice soothing tone “don’t angry yet wish could show cat dinah think you’d take fancy cats could see dear quiet thing” alice went half swam lazily pool “and sits purring nicely fire licking paws washing face—and nice soft thing nurse—and she’s capital one catching mice—oh beg pardon” cried alice time mouse bristling felt certain must really offended “we won’t talk you’d rather not” “we indeed” cried mouse trembling end tail “as would talk subject family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things don’t let hear name again” “i won’t indeed” said alice great hurry change subject conversation “are you—are fond—of—of dogs” mouse answer alice went eagerly “there nice little dog near

it’s worth hundred pounds says kills rats and—oh dear” cried alice sorrowful tone “i’m afraid i’ve offended again” mouse swimming away hard could go making quite commotion pool went called softly “mouse dear come back won’t talk cats dogs either don’t like them” mouse heard turned round swam slowly back face quite pale passion alice thought said low trembling voice “let us get shore i’ll tell history you’ll understand hate cats dogs” high time go pool getting quite crowded birds animals fallen duck dodo lory eaglet several curious creatures alice led way whole party swam shore chapter iii caucusrace long tale indeed queerlooking party assembled bank—the birds draggled feathers animals fur clinging close dripping wet cross uncomfortable first question course get dry consultation minutes seemed quite natural alice find talking familiarly known life indeed quite long argument lory last turned sulky would say “i older must know better” alice would allow without knowing old lory positively refused tell age said last mouse seemed person authority among called “sit listen i’ll soon make dry enough” sat large ring mouse middle alice kept eyes anxiously fixed felt sure would catch bad cold get dry soon “ahem” said mouse important air “are ready driest thing know silence round please ‘william conqueror whose cause favoured pope soon submitted english wanted leaders late much accustomed usurpation conquest edwin morcar earls mercia northumbria—’” “ugh” said lory shiver “i beg pardon” said mouse frowning politely “did speak” “not i” said lory hastily “i thought did” said mouse “—i proceed ‘edwin morcar earls mercia northumbria declared even stigand patriotic archbishop canterbury found advisable—’” “found what” said duck “found it” mouse replied rather crossly “of course know ‘it’ means” “i know ‘it’ means well enough find thing” said duck “it’s generally frog worm question archbishop find” mouse notice question hurriedly went “‘—found advisable go edgar atheling meet william offer crown william’s conduct first moderate insolence normans—’ getting dear” continued turning alice spoke “as wet ever” said alice melancholy tone “it doesn’t seem dry all” “in case” said dodo solemnly rising feet “i move meeting adjourn immediate adoption energetic remedies—” “speak english” said eaglet “i don’t know meaning half long words what’s don’t believe either” eaglet bent head hide smile birds tittered audibly “what going say” said dodo offended tone “was best thing get us dry would caucusrace” “what caucusrace” said alice wanted much know dodo paused thought somebody ought speak one else seemed inclined say anything “why” said dodo “the best way explain it” might like try thing winter day tell dodo managed first marked racecourse sort circle “the exact shape doesn’t matter” said party placed along course “one two three away” began running liked left liked easy know race however running half hour quite dry dodo suddenly called “the race over” crowded round panting asking “but won” question dodo could answer without great deal thought sat long time one finger pressed upon forehead position usually see shakespeare pictures rest waited silence last dodo said “everybody must prizes” “but give prizes” quite chorus voices asked “why course” said dodo pointing alice one finger whole party crowded round calling confused way “prizes prizes” alice idea despair put hand pocket pulled box comfits luckily salt water got handed round prizes exactly one apiece round “but must prize know” said mouse “of course” dodo replied gravely “what else got pocket” went turning alice “only thimble” said alice sadly “hand here” said dodo crowded round dodo solemnly presented thimble saying “we beg acceptance elegant thimble” finished short speech cheered alice thought whole thing absurd looked grave dare laugh could think anything say simply bowed took thimble looking solemn could next thing eat comfits caused noise confusion large birds complained could taste small ones choked patted back however last sat ring begged mouse tell something “you promised tell history know” said alice “and hate—c d” added whisper half afraid would offended “mine long sad tale” said mouse turning alice sighing “it long tail certainly” said alice looking wonder mouse’s tail “but call sad” kept puzzling mouse speaking idea tale something like this— “fury said mouse met house ‘let us go law prosecute you—come i’ll take denial must trial really morning i’ve nothing do’ said mouse cur ‘such trial dear sir jury judge would wasting breath’ ‘i’ll judge i’ll jury’ said cunning old fury ‘i’ll try whole cause condemn death’” “you attending” said mouse alice severely “what thinking of” “i beg pardon” said alice humbly “you got fifth bend think” “i not” cried mouse sharply angrily “a knot” said alice always ready make useful looking anxiously “oh let help undo it” “i shall nothing sort” said mouse getting walking away “you insult talking nonsense” “i didn’t mean it” pleaded poor alice “but you’re easily offended know” mouse growled reply “please come back finish story” alice called others joined chorus “yes please do” mouse shook head impatiently walked little quicker “what pity wouldn’t stay” sighed lory soon quite sight old crab took opportunity saying daughter “ah dear let lesson never lose temper” “hold tongue ma” said young crab little snappishly “you’re enough try patience oyster” “i wish dinah know do” said alice aloud addressing nobody particular “she’d soon fetch back” “and dinah might venture ask question” said lory alice replied eagerly always ready talk pet “dinah’s cat she’s capital one catching mice can’t think oh wish could see birds she’ll eat little bird soon look it” speech caused remarkable sensation among party birds hurried one old magpie began wrapping carefully remarking “i really must getting home nightair doesn’t suit throat” canary called trembling voice children “come away dears it’s high time bed” various pretexts moved alice soon left alone “i wish hadn’t mentioned dinah” said melancholy tone “nobody seems like i’m sure she’s best cat world oh dear dinah wonder shall ever see more” poor alice began cry felt lonely lowspirited little however heard little pattering footsteps distance looked eagerly half hoping mouse changed mind coming back finish story chapter iv rabbit sends little bill white rabbit trotting slowly back looking anxiously went lost something heard muttering “the duchess duchess oh dear paws oh fur whiskers she’ll get executed sure ferrets ferrets dropped wonder” alice guessed moment looking fan pair white kid gloves goodnaturedly began hunting nowhere seen—everything seemed changed since swim pool great hall glass table little door vanished completely soon rabbit noticed alice went hunting called angry tone “why mary ann run home moment fetch pair gloves fan quick now” alice much frightened ran direction pointed without trying explain mistake made “he took housemaid” said ran “how surprised he’ll finds i’d better take fan gloves—that find them” said came upon neat little house door bright brass plate name “w rabbit” engraved upon went without knocking hurried upstairs great fear lest meet real mary ann turned house found fan gloves “how queer seems” alice said “to going messages rabbit suppose dinah’ll sending messages next” began fancying sort thing would happen “‘miss alice come directly get ready walk’ ‘coming minute nurse i’ve got see mouse doesn’t get out’ don’t think” alice went “that they’d let dinah stop house began ordering people like that” time found way tidy little room table window hoped fan two three pairs tiny white kid gloves took fan pair gloves going leave room eye fell upon little bottle stood near lookingglass label time words “drink me” nevertheless uncorked put lips “i know something interesting sure happen” said “whenever eat drink anything i’ll see bottle hope it’ll make grow large really i’m quite tired tiny little thing” indeed much sooner expected drunk half bottle found head pressing ceiling stoop save neck broken hastily put bottle saying “that’s quite enough—i hope shan’t grow more—as can’t get door—i wish hadn’t drunk quite much” alas late wish went growing growing soon kneel floor another minute even room tried effect lying one elbow door arm curled round head still went growing last resource put one arm window one foot chimney said “now whatever happens become me” luckily alice little magic bottle full effect grew larger still uncomfortable seemed sort chance ever getting room wonder felt unhappy “it much pleasanter home” thought poor alice “when one wasn’t always growing larger smaller ordered mice rabbits almost wish hadn’t gone rabbithole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious know sort life wonder happened used read fairytales fancied kind thing never happened middle one ought book written ought grow i’ll write one—but i’m grown now” added sorrowful tone “at least there’s room grow here” “but then” thought alice “shall never get older that’ll comfort one way—never old woman—but then—always lessons learn oh shouldn’t like that” “oh foolish alice” answered “how learn lessons there’s hardly room room lessonbooks” went taking first one side making quite conversation altogether minutes heard voice outside stopped listen “mary ann mary ann” said voice “fetch gloves moment” came little pattering feet stairs alice knew rabbit coming look trembled till shook house quite forgetting thousand times large rabbit reason afraid presently rabbit came door tried open door opened inwards alice’s elbow pressed hard attempt proved failure alice heard say “then i’ll go round get window” “that won’t” thought alice waiting till fancied heard rabbit window suddenly spread hand made snatch air get hold anything heard little shriek fall crash broken glass concluded possible fallen cucumberframe something sort next came angry voice—the rabbit’s—“pat pat you” voice never heard “sure i’m digging apples yer honour” “digging apples indeed” said rabbit angrily “here come help this” sounds broken glass “now tell pat what’s window” “sure it’s arm yer honour” pronounced “arrum” “an arm goose ever saw one size fills whole window” “sure yer honour it’s arm that” “well it’s got business rate go take away” long silence alice could hear whispers “sure don’t like yer honour all” “do tell coward” last spread hand made another snatch air time two little shrieks sounds broken glass “what number cucumberframes must be” thought alice “i wonder they’ll next pulling window wish could i’m sure don’t want stay longer” waited time without hearing anything last came rumbling little cartwheels sound good many voices talking together made words “where’s ladder—why hadn’t bring one bill’s got other—bill fetch lad—here put ’em corner—no tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—oh they’ll well enough don’t particular—here bill catch hold rope—will roof bear—mind loose slate—oh it’s coming heads below” loud crash—“now that—it bill fancy—who’s go chimney—nay shan’t it—that won’t then—bill’s go down—here bill master says you’re go chimney” “oh bill’s got come chimney he” said alice “shy seem put everything upon bill wouldn’t bill’s place good deal fireplace narrow sure think kick little” drew foot far chimney could waited till heard little animal couldn’t guess sort scratching scrambling chimney close saying “this bill” gave one sharp kick waited see would happen next first thing heard general chorus “there goes bill” rabbit’s voice along—“catch hedge” silence another confusion voices—“hold head—brandy now—don’t choke him—how old fellow happened tell us it” last came little feeble squeaking voice “that’s bill” thought alice “well hardly know—no thank ye i’m better now—but i’m deal flustered tell you—all know something comes like jackinthebox goes like skyrocket” “so old fellow” said others “we must burn house down” said rabbit’s voice alice called loud could “if i’ll set dinah you” dead silence instantly alice thought “i wonder next sense they’d take roof off” minute two began moving alice heard rabbit say “a barrowful begin with” “a barrowful what” thought alice long doubt next moment shower little pebbles came rattling window hit face “i’ll put stop this” said shouted “you’d better again” produced another dead silence alice noticed surprise pebbles turning little cakes lay floor bright idea came head “if eat one cakes” thought “it’s sure make change size can’t possibly make larger must make smaller suppose” swallowed one cakes delighted find began shrinking directly soon small enough get door ran house found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside poor little lizard bill middle held two guineapigs giving something bottle made rush alice moment appeared ran hard could soon found safe thick wood “the first thing i’ve got do” said alice wandered wood “is grow right size second thing find way lovely garden think best plan” sounded excellent plan doubt neatly simply arranged difficulty smallest idea set peering anxiously among trees little sharp bark head made look great hurry enormous puppy looking large round eyes feebly stretching one paw trying touch “poor little thing” said alice coaxing tone tried hard whistle terribly frightened time thought might hungry case would likely eat spite coaxing hardly knowing picked little bit stick held puppy whereupon puppy jumped air feet yelp delight rushed stick made believe worry alice dodged behind great thistle keep run moment appeared side puppy made another rush stick tumbled head heels hurry get hold alice thinking like game play carthorse expecting every moment trampled feet ran round thistle puppy began series short charges stick running little way forwards time long way back barking hoarsely till last sat good way panting tongue hanging mouth great eyes half shut seemed alice good opportunity making escape set ran till quite tired breath till puppy’s bark sounded quite faint distance “and yet dear little puppy was” said alice leant buttercup rest fanned one leaves “i liked teaching tricks much if—if i’d right size oh dear i’d nearly forgotten i’ve got grow let see—how managed suppose ought eat drink something great question what” great question certainly alice looked round flowers blades grass see anything looked like right thing eat drink circumstances large mushroom growing near height looked sides behind occurred might well look see top stretched tiptoe peeped edge mushroom eyes immediately met large blue caterpillar sitting top arms folded quietly smoking long hookah taking smallest notice anything else chapter v advice caterpillar caterpillar alice looked time silence last caterpillar took hookah mouth addressed languid sleepy voice “who you” said caterpillar encouraging opening conversation alice replied rather shyly “i—i hardly know sir present—at least know got morning think must changed several times since then” “what mean that” said caterpillar sternly “explain yourself” “i can’t explain i’m afraid sir” said alice “because i’m see” “i don’t see” said caterpillar “i’m afraid can’t put clearly” alice replied politely “for can’t understand begin many different sizes day confusing” “it isn’t” said caterpillar “well perhaps haven’t found yet” said alice “but turn chrysalis—you day know—and butterfly think you’ll feel little queer won’t you” “not bit” said caterpillar “well perhaps feelings may different” said alice “all know would feel queer me” “you” said caterpillar contemptuously “who you” brought back beginning conversation alice felt little irritated caterpillar’s making short remarks drew said gravely “i think ought tell first” “why” said caterpillar another puzzling question alice could think good reason caterpillar seemed unpleasant state mind turned away “come back” caterpillar called “i’ve something important say” sounded promising certainly alice turned came back “keep temper” said caterpillar “is all” said alice swallowing anger well could “no” said caterpillar alice thought might well wait nothing else perhaps might tell something worth hearing minutes puffed away without speaking last unfolded arms took hookah mouth said “so think you’re changed you” “i’m afraid sir” said alice “i can’t remember things used—and don’t keep size ten minutes together” “can’t remember things” said caterpillar “well i’ve tried say “how doth little busy bee” came different” alice replied melancholy voice “repeat “you old father william’” said caterpillar alice folded hands began— “you old father william” young man said “and hair become white yet incessantly stand head— think age right” “in youth” father william replied son “i feared might injure brain i’m perfectly sure none again” “you old” said youth “as mentioned grown uncommonly fat yet turned backsomersault door— pray reason that” “in youth” said sage shook grey locks “i kept limbs supple use ointment—one shilling box— allow sell couple” “you old” said youth “and jaws weak anything tougher suet yet finished goose bones beak— pray manage it” “in youth” said father “i took law argued case wife muscular strength gave jaw lasted rest life” “you old” said youth “one would hardly suppose eye steady ever yet balanced eel end nose— made awfully clever” “i answered three questions enough” said father “don’t give airs think listen day stuff i’ll kick stairs” “that said right” said caterpillar “not quite right i’m afraid” said alice timidly “some words got altered” “it wrong beginning end” said caterpillar decidedly silence minutes caterpillar first speak “what size want be” asked “oh i’m particular size” alice hastily replied “only one doesn’t like changing often know” “i don’t know” said caterpillar alice said nothing never much contradicted life felt losing temper “are content now” said caterpillar “well like little larger sir wouldn’t mind” said alice “three inches wretched height be” “it good height indeed” said caterpillar angrily rearing upright spoke exactly three inches high “but i’m used it” pleaded poor alice piteous tone thought “i wish creatures wouldn’t easily offended” “you’ll get used time” said caterpillar put hookah mouth began smoking time alice waited patiently chose speak minute two caterpillar took hookah mouth yawned twice shook got mushroom crawled away grass merely remarking went “one side make grow taller side make grow shorter” “one side side what” thought alice “of mushroom” said caterpillar asked aloud another moment sight alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom minute trying make two sides perfectly round found difficult question however last stretched arms round far would go broke bit edge hand “and which” said nibbled little righthand bit try effect next moment felt violent blow underneath chin struck foot good deal frightened sudden change felt time lost shrinking rapidly set work eat bit chin pressed closely foot hardly room open mouth last managed swallow morsel lefthand bit “come head’s free last” said alice tone delight changed alarm another moment found shoulders nowhere found could see looked immense length neck seemed rise like stalk sea green leaves lay far “what green stuff be” said alice “and shoulders got oh poor hands can’t see you” moving spoke result seemed follow except little shaking among distant green leaves seemed chance getting hands head tried get head delighted find neck would bend easily direction like serpent succeeded curving graceful zigzag going dive among leaves found nothing tops trees wandering sharp hiss made draw back hurry large pigeon flown face beating violently wings “serpent” screamed pigeon “i’m serpent” said alice indignantly “let alone” “serpent say again” repeated pigeon subdued tone added kind sob “i’ve tried every way nothing seems suit them” “i haven’t least idea you’re talking about” said alice “i’ve tried roots trees i’ve tried banks i’ve tried hedges” pigeon went without attending “but serpents there’s pleasing them” alice puzzled thought use saying anything till pigeon finished “as wasn’t trouble enough hatching eggs” said pigeon “but must lookout serpents night day haven’t wink sleep three weeks” “i’m sorry you’ve annoyed” said alice beginning see meaning “and i’d taken highest tree wood” continued pigeon raising voice shriek “and thinking free last must needs come wriggling sky ugh serpent” “but i’m serpent tell you” said alice “i’m a—i’m a—” “well you” said pigeon “i see you’re trying invent something” “i—i’m little girl” said alice rather doubtfully remembered number changes gone day “a likely story indeed” said pigeon tone deepest contempt “i’ve seen good many little girls time never one neck you’re serpent there’s use denying suppose you’ll telling next never tasted egg” “i tasted eggs certainly” said alice truthful child “but little girls eat eggs quite much serpents know” “i don’t believe it” said pigeon “but they’re kind serpent that’s say” new idea alice quite silent minute two gave pigeon opportunity adding “you’re looking eggs know well enough matter whether you’re little girl serpent” “it matters good deal me” said alice hastily “but i’m looking eggs happens shouldn’t want don’t like raw” “well then” said pigeon sulky tone settled nest alice crouched among trees well could neck kept getting entangled among branches every stop untwist remembered still held pieces mushroom hands set work carefully nibbling first one growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter succeeded bringing usual height long since anything near right size felt quite strange first got used minutes began talking usual “come there’s half plan done puzzling changes i’m never sure i’m going one minute another however i’ve got back right size next thing get beautiful garden—how done wonder” said came suddenly upon open place little house four feet high “whoever lives there” thought alice “it’ll never come upon size frighten wits” began nibbling righthand bit venture go near house till brought nine inches high chapter vi pig pepper minute two stood looking house wondering next suddenly footman livery came running wood—she considered footman livery otherwise judging face would called fish—and rapped loudly door knuckles opened another footman livery round face large eyes like frog footmen alice noticed powdered hair curled heads felt curious know crept little way wood listen fishfootman began producing arm great letter nearly large handed saying solemn tone “for duchess invitation queen play croquet” frogfootman repeated solemn tone changing order words little “from queen invitation duchess play croquet” bowed low curls got entangled together alice laughed much run back wood fear hearing next peeped fishfootman gone sitting ground near door staring stupidly sky alice went timidly door knocked “there’s sort use knocking” said footman “and two reasons first i’m side door secondly they’re making noise inside one could possibly hear you” certainly extraordinary noise going within—a constant howling sneezing every great crash dish kettle broken pieces “please then” said alice “how get in” “there might sense knocking” footman went without attending “if door us instance inside might knock could let know” looking sky time speaking alice thought decidedly uncivil “but perhaps can’t help it” said “his eyes nearly top head rate might answer questions—how get in” repeated aloud “i shall sit here” footman remarked “till tomorrow—” moment door house opened large plate came skimming straight footman’s head grazed nose broke pieces one trees behind “—or next day maybe” footman continued tone exactly nothing happened “how get in” asked alice louder tone “are get all” said footman “that’s first question know” doubt alice like told “it’s really dreadful” muttered “the way creatures argue it’s enough drive one crazy” footman seemed think good opportunity repeating remark variations “i shall sit here” said “on days days” “but do” said alice “anything like” said footman began whistling “oh there’s use talking him” said alice desperately “he’s perfectly idiotic” opened door went door led right large kitchen full smoke one end duchess sitting threelegged stool middle nursing baby cook leaning fire stirring large cauldron seemed full soup “there’s certainly much pepper soup” alice said well could sneezing certainly much air even duchess sneezed occasionally baby sneezing howling alternately without moment’s pause things kitchen sneeze cook large cat sitting hearth grinning ear ear “please would tell me” said alice little timidly quite sure whether good manners speak first “why cat grins like that” “it’s cheshire cat” said duchess “and that’s pig” said last word sudden violence alice quite jumped saw another moment addressed baby took courage went again— “i didn’t know cheshire cats always grinned fact didn’t know cats could grin” “they can” said duchess “and ’em do” “i don’t know do” alice said politely feeling quite pleased got conversation “you don’t know much” said duchess “and that’s fact” alice like tone remark thought would well introduce subject conversation trying fix one cook took cauldron soup fire set work throwing everything

beautiful garden among bright flowerbeds cool fountains chapter viii queen’s croquetground large rosetree stood near entrance garden roses growing white three gardeners busily painting red alice thought curious thing went nearer watch came heard one say “look five don’t go splashing paint like that” “i couldn’t help it” said five sulky tone “seven jogged elbow” seven looked said “that’s right five always lay blame others” “you’d better talk” said five “i heard queen say yesterday deserved beheaded” “what for” said one spoken first “that’s none business two” said seven “yes business” said five “and i’ll tell him—it bringing cook tuliproots instead onions” seven flung brush begun “well unjust things—” eye chanced fall upon alice stood watching checked suddenly others looked round also bowed low “would tell me” said alice little timidly “why painting roses” five seven said nothing looked two two began low voice “why fact see miss ought red rosetree put white one mistake queen find heads cut know see miss we’re best afore comes to—” moment five anxiously looking across garden called “the queen queen” three gardeners instantly threw flat upon faces sound many footsteps alice looked round eager see queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs shaped like three gardeners oblong flat hands feet corners next ten courtiers ornamented diamonds walked two two soldiers came royal children ten little dears came jumping merrily along hand hand couples ornamented hearts next came guests mostly kings queens among alice recognised white rabbit talking hurried nervous manner smiling everything said went without noticing followed knave hearts carrying king’s crown crimson velvet cushion last grand procession came king queen hearts alice rather doubtful whether ought lie face like three gardeners could remember ever heard rule processions “and besides would use procession” thought “if people lie upon faces couldn’t see it” stood still waited procession came opposite alice stopped looked queen said severely “who this” said knave hearts bowed smiled reply “idiot” said queen tossing head impatiently turning alice went “what’s name child” “my name alice please majesty” said alice politely added “why they’re pack cards needn’t afraid them” “and these” said queen pointing three gardeners lying round rosetree see lying faces pattern backs rest pack could tell whether gardeners soldiers courtiers three children “how know” said alice surprised courage “it’s business mine” queen turned crimson fury glaring moment like wild beast screamed “off head off—” “nonsense” said alice loudly decidedly queen silent king laid hand upon arm timidly said “consider dear child” queen turned angrily away said knave “turn over” knave carefully one foot “get up” said queen shrill loud voice three gardeners instantly jumped began bowing king queen royal children everybody else “leave that” screamed queen “you make giddy” turning rosetree went “what here” “may please majesty” said two humble tone going one knee spoke “we trying—” “i see” said queen meanwhile examining roses “off heads” procession moved three soldiers remaining behind execute unfortunate gardeners ran alice protection “you shan’t beheaded” said alice put large flowerpot stood near three soldiers wandered minute two looking quietly marched others “are heads off” shouted queen “their heads gone please majesty” soldiers shouted reply “that’s right” shouted queen “can play croquet” soldiers silent looked alice question evidently meant “yes” shouted alice “come then” roared queen alice joined procession wondering much would happen next “it’s—it’s fine day” said timid voice side walking white rabbit peeping anxiously face “very” said alice “—where’s duchess” “hush hush” said rabbit low hurried tone looked anxiously shoulder spoke raised upon tiptoe put mouth close ear whispered “she’s sentence execution” “what for” said alice “did say ‘what pity’” rabbit asked “no didn’t” said alice “i don’t think it’s pity said ‘what for’” “she boxed queen’s ears—” rabbit began alice gave little scream laughter “oh hush” rabbit whispered frightened tone “the queen hear see came rather late queen said—” “get places” shouted queen voice thunder people began running directions tumbling however got settled minute two game began alice thought never seen curious croquetground life ridges furrows balls live hedgehogs mallets live flamingoes soldiers double stand hands feet make arches chief difficulty alice found first managing flamingo succeeded getting body tucked away comfortably enough arm legs hanging generally got neck nicely straightened going give hedgehog blow head would twist round look face puzzled expression could help bursting laughing got head going begin provoking find hedgehog unrolled act crawling away besides generally ridge furrow way wherever wanted send hedgehog doubledup soldiers always getting walking parts ground alice soon came conclusion difficult game indeed players played without waiting turns quarrelling fighting hedgehogs short time queen furious passion went stamping shouting “off head” “off head” minute alice began feel uneasy sure yet dispute queen knew might happen minute “and then” thought “what would become they’re dreadfully fond beheading people great wonder there’s one left alive” looking way escape wondering whether could get away without seen noticed curious appearance air puzzled much first watching minute two made grin said “it’s cheshire cat shall somebody talk to” “how getting on” said cat soon mouth enough speak alice waited till eyes appeared nodded “it’s use speaking it” thought “till ears come least one them” another minute whole head appeared alice put flamingo began account game feeling glad someone listen cat seemed think enough sight appeared “i don’t think play fairly” alice began rather complaining tone “and quarrel dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and don’t seem rules particular least nobody attends them—and you’ve idea confusing things alive instance there’s arch i’ve got go next walking end ground—and croqueted queen’s hedgehog ran away saw mine coming” “how like queen” said cat low voice “not all” said alice “she’s extremely—” noticed queen close behind listening went “—likely win it’s hardly worth finishing game” queen smiled passed “who talking to” said king going alice looking cat’s head great curiosity “it’s friend mine—a cheshire cat” said alice “allow introduce it” “i don’t like look all” said king “however may kiss hand likes” “i’d rather not” cat remarked “don’t impertinent” said king “and don’t look like that” got behind alice spoke “a cat may look king” said alice “i’ve read book don’t remember where” “well must removed” said king decidedly called queen passing moment “my dear wish would cat removed” queen one way settling difficulties great small “off head” said without even looking round “i’ll fetch executioner myself” said king eagerly hurried alice thought might well go back see game going heard queen’s voice distance screaming passion already heard sentence three players executed missed turns like look things game confusion never knew whether turn went search hedgehog hedgehog engaged fight another hedgehog seemed alice excellent opportunity croqueting one difficulty flamingo gone across side garden alice could see trying helpless sort way fly tree time caught flamingo brought back fight hedgehogs sight “but doesn’t matter much” thought alice “as arches gone side ground” tucked away arm might escape went back little conversation friend got back cheshire cat surprised find quite large crowd collected round dispute going executioner king queen talking rest quite silent looked uncomfortable moment alice appeared appealed three settle question repeated arguments though spoke found hard indeed make exactly said executioner’s argument couldn’t cut head unless body cut never thing wasn’t going begin time life king’s argument anything head could beheaded weren’t talk nonsense queen’s argument something wasn’t done less time she’d everybody executed round last remark made whole party look grave anxious alice could think nothing else say “it belongs duchess you’d better ask it” “she’s prison” queen said executioner “fetch here” executioner went like arrow cat’s head began fading away moment gone time come back duchess entirely disappeared king executioner ran wildly looking rest party went back game chapter ix mock turtle’s story “you can’t think glad see dear old thing” said duchess tucked arm affectionately alice’s walked together alice glad find pleasant temper thought perhaps pepper made savage met kitchen “when i’m duchess” said hopeful tone though “i won’t pepper kitchen soup well without—maybe it’s always pepper makes people hottempered” went much pleased found new kind rule “and vinegar makes sour—and camomile makes bitter—and—and barleysugar things make children sweettempered wish people knew wouldn’t stingy know—” quite forgotten duchess time little startled heard voice close ear “you’re thinking something dear makes forget talk can’t tell moral shall remember bit” “perhaps hasn’t one” alice ventured remark “tut tut child” said duchess “everything’s got moral find it” squeezed closer alice’s side spoke alice much like keeping close first duchess ugly secondly exactly right height rest chin upon alice’s shoulder uncomfortably sharp chin however like rude bore well could “the game’s going rather better now” said way keeping conversation little “’tis so” said duchess “and moral is—‘oh ’tis love ’tis love makes world go round’” “somebody said” alice whispered “that it’s done everybody minding business” “ah well means much thing” said duchess digging sharp little chin alice’s shoulder added “and moral is—‘take care sense sounds take care themselves’” “how fond finding morals things” alice thought “i dare say you’re wondering don’t put arm round waist” duchess said pause “the reason i’m doubtful temper flamingo shall try experiment” “he might bite” alice cautiously replied feeling anxious experiment tried “very true” said duchess “flamingoes mustard bite moral is—‘birds feather flock together’” “only mustard isn’t bird” alice remarked “right usual” said duchess “what clear way putting things” “it’s mineral think” said alice “of course is” said duchess seemed ready agree everything alice said “there’s large mustardmine near moral is—‘the mine less yours’” “oh know” exclaimed alice attended last remark “it’s vegetable doesn’t look like one is” “i quite agree you” said duchess “and moral is—‘be would seem be’—or you’d like put simply—‘never imagine otherwise might appear others might otherwise would appeared otherwise’” “i think understand better” alice said politely “if written can’t quite follow say it” “that’s nothing could say chose” duchess replied pleased tone “pray don’t trouble say longer that” said alice “oh don’t talk trouble” said duchess “i make present everything i’ve said yet” “a cheap sort present” thought alice “i’m glad don’t give birthday presents like that” venture say loud “thinking again” duchess asked another dig sharp little chin “i’ve right think” said alice sharply beginning feel little worried “just much right” said duchess “as pigs fly m—” alice’s great surprise duchess’s voice died away even middle favourite word ‘moral’ arm linked began tremble alice looked stood queen front arms folded frowning like thunderstorm “a fine day majesty” duchess began low weak voice “now give fair warning” shouted queen stamping ground spoke “either head must half time take choice” duchess took choice gone moment “let’s go game” queen said alice alice much frightened say word slowly followed back croquetground guests taken advantage queen’s absence resting shade however moment saw hurried back game queen merely remarking moment’s delay would cost lives time playing queen never left quarrelling players shouting “off head” “off head” sentenced taken custody soldiers course leave arches end half hour arches left players except king queen alice custody sentence execution queen left quite breath said alice “have seen mock turtle yet” “no” said alice “i don’t even know mock turtle is” “it’s thing mock turtle soup made from” said queen “i never saw one heard

executions queen ordered soon came upon gryphon lying fast asleep sun don’t know gryphon look picture “up lazy thing” said queen “and take young lady see mock turtle hear history must go back see executions ordered” walked leaving alice alone gryphon alice quite like look creature whole thought would quite safe stay go savage queen waited gryphon sat rubbed eyes watched queen till sight chuckled “what fun” said gryphon half half alice “what fun” said alice “why she” said gryphon “it’s fancy never executes nobody know come on” “everybody says ‘come on’ here” thought alice went slowly “i never ordered life never” gone far saw mock turtle distance sitting sad lonely little ledge rock came nearer alice could hear sighing heart would break pitied deeply “what sorrow” asked gryphon gryphon answered nearly words “it’s fancy hasn’t got sorrow know come on” went mock turtle looked large eyes full tears said nothing “this young lady” said gryphon “she wants know history do” “i’ll tell her” said mock turtle deep hollow tone “sit don’t speak word till i’ve finished” sat nobody spoke minutes alice thought “i don’t see ever finish doesn’t begin” waited patiently “once” said mock turtle last deep sigh “i real turtle” words followed long silence broken occasional exclamation “hjckrrh” gryphon constant heavy sobbing mock turtle alice nearly getting saying “thank sir interesting story” could help thinking must come sat still said nothing “when little” mock turtle went last calmly though still sobbing little “we went school sea master old turtle—we used call tortoise—” “why call tortoise wasn’t one” alice asked “we called tortoise taught us” said mock turtle angrily “really dull” “you ought ashamed asking simple question” added gryphon sat silent looked poor alice felt ready sink earth last gryphon said mock turtle “drive old fellow don’t day it” went words “yes went school sea though mayn’t believe it—” “i never said didn’t” interrupted alice “you did” said mock turtle “hold tongue” added gryphon alice could speak mock turtle went “we best educations—in fact went school every day—” “i’ve dayschool too” said alice “you needn’t proud that” “with extras” asked mock turtle little anxiously “yes” said alice “we learned french music” “and washing” said mock turtle “certainly not” said alice indignantly “ah wasn’t really good school” said mock turtle tone great relief “now end bill ‘french music washing—extra’” “you couldn’t wanted much” said alice “living bottom sea” “i couldn’t afford learn it” said mock turtle sigh “i took regular course” “what that” inquired alice “reeling writhing course begin with” mock turtle replied “and different branches arithmetic—ambition distraction uglification derision” “i never heard ‘uglification’” alice ventured say “what it” gryphon lifted paws surprise “what never heard uglifying” exclaimed “you know beautify suppose” “yes” said alice doubtfully “it means—to—make—anything—prettier” “well then” gryphon went “if don’t know uglify simpleton” alice feel encouraged ask questions turned mock turtle said “what else learn” “well mystery” mock turtle replied counting subjects flappers “—mystery ancient modern seaography drawling—the drawlingmaster old congereel used come week taught us drawling stretching fainting coils” “what like” said alice “well can’t show myself” mock turtle said “i’m stiff gryphon never learnt it” “hadn’t time” said gryphon “i went classics master though old crab was” “i never went him” mock turtle said sigh “he taught laughing grief used say” “so did” said gryphon sighing turn creatures hid faces paws “and many hours day lessons” said alice hurry change subject “ten hours first day” said mock turtle “nine next on” “what curious plan” exclaimed alice “that’s reason they’re called lessons” gryphon remarked “because lessen day day” quite new idea alice thought little made next remark “then eleventh day must holiday” “of course was” said mock turtle “and manage twelfth” alice went eagerly “that’s enough lessons” gryphon interrupted decided tone “tell something games now” chapter x lobster quadrille mock turtle sighed deeply drew back one flapper across eyes looked alice tried speak minute two sobs choked voice “same bone throat” said gryphon set work shaking punching back last mock turtle recovered voice tears running cheeks went again— “you may lived much sea—” “i haven’t” said alice—“and perhaps never even introduced lobster—” alice began say “i tasted—” checked hastily said “no never” “—so idea delightful thing lobster quadrille is” “no indeed” said alice “what sort dance it” “why” said gryphon “you first form line along seashore—” “two lines” cried mock turtle “seals turtles salmon you’ve cleared jellyfish way—” “that generally takes time” interrupted gryphon “—you advance twice—” “each lobster partner” cried gryphon “of course” mock turtle said “advance twice set partners—” “—change lobsters retire order” continued gryphon “then know” mock turtle went “you throw the—” “the lobsters” shouted gryphon bound air “—as far sea can—” “swim them” screamed gryphon “turn somersault sea” cried mock turtle capering wildly “change lobsters again” yelled gryphon top voice “back land that’s first figure” said mock turtle suddenly dropping voice two creatures jumping like mad things time sat sadly quietly looked alice “it must pretty dance” said alice timidly “would like see little it” said mock turtle “very much indeed” said alice “come let’s try first figure” said mock turtle gryphon “we without lobsters know shall sing” “oh sing” said gryphon “i’ve forgotten words” began solemnly dancing round round alice every treading toes passed close waving forepaws mark time mock turtle sang slowly sadly— “will walk little faster” said whiting snail “there’s porpoise close behind us he’s treading tail see eagerly lobsters turtles advance waiting shingle—will come join dance won’t won’t join dance won’t won’t won’t join dance “you really notion delightful take us throw us lobsters sea” snail replied “too far far” gave look askance— said thanked whiting kindly would join dance would could would could would join dance would could would could could join dance “what matters far go” scaly friend replied “there another shore know upon side england nearer france— turn pale beloved snail come join dance won’t won’t join dance won’t won’t won’t join dance” “thank it’s interesting dance watch” said alice feeling glad last “and like curious song whiting” “oh whiting” said mock turtle “they—you’ve seen course” “yes” said alice “i’ve often seen dinn—” checked hastily “i don’t know dinn may be” said mock turtle “but you’ve seen often course know they’re like” “i believe so” alice replied thoughtfully “they tails mouths—and they’re crumbs” “you’re wrong crumbs” said mock turtle “crumbs would wash sea tails mouths reason is—” mock turtle yawned shut eyes—“tell reason that” said gryphon “the reason is” said gryphon “that would go lobsters dance got thrown sea fall long way got tails fast mouths couldn’t get that’s all” “thank you” said alice “it’s interesting never knew much whiting before” “i tell like” said gryphon “do know it’s called whiting” “i never thought it” said alice “why” “it boots shoes” gryphon replied solemnly alice thoroughly puzzled “does boots shoes” repeated wondering tone “why shoes done with” said gryphon “i mean makes shiny” alice looked considered little gave answer “they’re done blacking believe” “boots shoes sea” gryphon went deep voice “are done whiting know” “and made of” alice asked tone great curiosity “soles eels course” gryphon replied rather impatiently “any shrimp could told that” “if i’d whiting” said alice whose thoughts still running song “i’d said porpoise ‘keep back please don’t want us’” “they obliged them” mock turtle said “no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise” “wouldn’t really” said alice tone great surprise “of course not” said mock turtle “why fish came told going journey say ‘with porpoise’” “don’t mean ‘purpose’” said alice “i mean say” mock turtle replied offended tone gryphon added “come let’s hear adventures” “i could tell adventures—beginning morning” said alice little timidly “but it’s use going back yesterday different person then” “explain that” said mock turtle “no adventures first” said gryphon impatient tone “explanations take dreadful time” alice began telling adventures time first saw white rabbit little nervous first two creatures got close one side opened eyes mouths wide gained courage went listeners perfectly quiet till got part repeating “you old father william” caterpillar words coming different mock turtle drew long breath said “that’s curious” “it’s curious be” said gryphon “it came different” mock turtle repeated thoughtfully “i like hear try repeat something tell begin” looked gryphon thought kind authority alice “stand repeat ‘’tis voice sluggard’” said gryphon “how creatures order one make one repeat lessons” thought alice “i might well school once” however got began repeat head full lobster quadrille hardly knew saying words came queer indeed— “’tis voice lobster heard declare “you baked brown must sugar hair” duck eyelids nose trims belt buttons turns toes” later editions continued follows sands dry gay lark talk contemptuous tones shark tide rises sharks around voice timid tremulous sound “that’s different used say child” said gryphon “well never heard before” said mock turtle “but sounds uncommon nonsense” alice said nothing sat face hands wondering anything would ever happen natural way “i like explained” said mock turtle “she can’t explain it” said gryphon hastily “go next verse” “but toes” mock turtle persisted “how could turn nose know” “it’s first position dancing” alice said dreadfully puzzled whole thing longed change subject “go next verse” gryphon repeated impatiently “it begins ‘i passed garden’” alice dare disobey though felt sure
